This is the VH1-IO benchmark example

See PDF document for extra information

Modules required

module load cray-hdf5
module load cray-netcdf
module load perftools-lite

Quick Build Instructions
cd src/; make

Quick Run Instructions
cd run; sbatch run_XXX.slurm  (as appropriate for your system)

Binaries should be placed in ./bin

Each run will produce several NetCDF output files (one per process).

The CrayPAT monitoring framework has been enabled for this application. It will produce a listing of the most important files by time taken for reading and writing. You can find this information in the vh1.o* outputfiles.

The striping of files is controlled by the settings in the run.slurm script

# Set Lustre stripes on the output directory
STRIPE_SIZE=2m
STRIPE_COUNT=1
lfs setstripe -c ${STRIPE_COUNT} -s ${STRIPE_SIZE} ${RUNDIR}/output

You can edit these settings and rerun the application.

What is the optimal stripe settings for this application?
